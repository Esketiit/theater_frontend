Theater is a project that I whipped up in two weeks for my graduation from Flatiron Academy! It's a platform for people to create, share and view playlists of videos quickly and easily. Theater is still a work in progress, so expect some changes and bugs to pop up as time goes on (help or tips of any kind is very much appeciated). 

 * To get things up and running(Theater's backend must be started before the frontend):
    * Once theater backend is up and running, navigate to theater_frontend in terminal
    * run 'npm install', wait for everything to install
    * run 'nom start' and enjoy

#### To-Do's
- [ ] Implement live chat and video streaming in rooms /(websockets)
- [ ] Make creating playlists and adding videos less cumbersome 
- [ ] Add more options for social interactions /(friends lists, favorite rooms, profile customization)
- [ ] Make it look nice
- [ ] Host on a server and show off to some friends!
